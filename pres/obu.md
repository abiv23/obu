# Authenticating Leads to Avoid Spam

## Issue
Obu receives inauthentic leads (spam), wasting time and resources for attorneys.

## Solution
Implement reCAPTCHA v3, honey pot inputs, or AI tools like Authenticity Leads/Leadzen.ai

## Details
- **reCAPTCHA v3**: Integrates into your Next.js forms (e.g., `LeadGen` component), scoring user activity (0–1) to detect bots without Turing tests (e.g., “select all images with a bus”). Scores < 0.5 flag spam, ensuring only human leads reach clients.
- **Honey Pot Input**: Add a hidden form field (e.g., `email_honeypot`) that bots fill but users don’t see. If filled, disable the “send” button or discard the lead.
- **AI Tools (Authenticity Leads/Leadzen.ai)**: Use real-time AI filtering in Next.js server actions or Vercel functions to analyze leads (e.g., email validity, behavior) and block spam, enhancing lead quality for legal marketing).

## Added Value
Owning your Next.js stack enables custom anti-spam solutions, unlike WordPress/Webflow’s limited options, driving higher ROI for Obu’s clients.

# Limitations of Using Tooling Like WordPress/Webflow

## Issue
Obu faces constraints with WordPress/Webflow, including limited customization, lack of code visibility, third-party reliance, and slow performance.

## Solution
Next.js with Storybook and Builder.io for front-end development

## Details
- **Limitations**:
  - Can’t build custom features or see all code, hindering robust testing (e.g., Jest, Playwright, Chromatic).
  - Reliance on third parties (e.g., plugins, hosting) risks downtime and security, unlike owning your stack.
  - Slow by nature due to CSR or plugin bloat, with PageSpeed scores often 60–80/100.
- **Solution**:
  - **Next.js**: Enables SSR, SSG, and full-stack ownership for custom, fast websites (e.g., `https://obu-interactive.vercel.app/`).
  - **Storybook**: Provides a front-end for non-devs to explore components (e.g., `https://obu-interactive.vercel.app//storybook`), tested via Jest, Playwright, and Chromatic.
  - **Builder.io**: Offers a drag-and-drop interface for designers/content writers, increasing reliability with tested components, accessible at `builder.io/content` with previews on your app.

## Added Value
Eliminates third-party risks, boosts speed (95–100/100 PageSpeed), and empowers non-technical teams, driving legal marketing growth.
